# Mini-CP-Library
A collection of CP algorithm implementations written and used by me when I was active on Codeforces / preparing for the ICPC.
The repository consists of three sets of CPP files (with bad documentation tbh), containing everything I used to use during contests on Codeforces, 
from Dijkstra and Sieve implementations to Segment Tree with Lazy Propagation.
